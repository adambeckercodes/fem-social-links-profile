## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties for maintainable styles
- Flexbox for layout and alignment
- Responsive design principles

### What I learned
This project helped me practice:
1. Using **CSS variables** for colors, spacing, and typography to create a consistent and scalable design system.
2. Structuring **semantic HTML** for better accessibility and clarity.
3. Creating a **mobile-first responsive design**, ensuring the layout adapts well to smaller screens.

### Continued development
For future improvements, I want to focus on:
- Adding **responsiveness** for larger screens and experimenting with **CSS Grid**.
- Enhancing **hover effects** and interactive animations to make the design more dynamic.
- Incorporating **JavaScript** to dynamically update the card content.

### Useful resources
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - For understanding semantic HTML and accessibility features.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - For building a flexible and responsive layout.
- [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - To ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards.
